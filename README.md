Unfortunately, Some technical problem occur in 1st start up.
We decided restart the full chain from the bigining.

- If you have any old-TUNE in your wallet, take a screen-shot.
- delete your daemon, qt, tunecore folder (.tunecore in linux)
  (You can find tunecore folder at C:\Users\"your windows id"\AppData\Roaming\TuneCore)
- addnode in your tunecore/tune.conf
  addnode = tunecrypto.com
- download new wallet, or compile, and run
